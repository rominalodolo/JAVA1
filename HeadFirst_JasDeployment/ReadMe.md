## This section is focused on Chapter 17 of this book - Package, Jars and Deployment 

## Release Your code 
- wrote code
- tested code
- refined code

now to... 
- organize, package, deploy

_" A java program is a bunch of classes. That's the output of your development. The real question is what to do with those classes when you're done. "_

## Deployment options: 
- Local: 
The entire application runs on the end-user’s computer, as a stand-alone,probably GUI, program, deployed as an executable JAR.

- Combinations of local and remote:
The application is distributed with a client portion running on the user’s local system, connected to a server where other parts of the application are running.

- Remote:
The entire Java application runs on a server system, with the client accessing the system through some non-Java means, probably a web browser.

### Separate source code and class files
_" The key is a combination of directory structure organization and the ```-d``` compiler option. "_
